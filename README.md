## Running the Service

### Manual Run

```bash
python stock_checker.py
```

### Install as System Service

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp microcenter-stock.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Create log directory
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/microcenter
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/log/microcenter

# Reload systemd and start service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable microcenter-stock
sudo systemctl start microcenter-stock
```

### Check Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status microcenter-stock
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

## Notifications

The system sends notifications for:
- Service startup/shutdown
- Product availability
- Service health (daily heartbeat)
- Error conditions
- Consecutive failures

    â””â”€â”€ test_notifications_integration.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_stock_checker.py
```

## Security

### Email Configuration
For Gmail, use an App Password instead of your account password:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
3. Create a new app password for this application
4. Use this password in your `config.env`

### Credential Safety
- Never commit your `config.env` file to version control
- Keep your Pushover tokens private
- Store logs in a directory with appropriate permissions
- Use environment variables in production environments
